# React Code Generator

## Overview

The React Code Generator is an application designed to process and execute code snippets in Python and React. For languages other than Python, the application displays an "Unknown Language" message. This tool not only generates React code but also saves and executes the code. Additionally, it checks for bugs within the code to enhance the development process.

## Features
